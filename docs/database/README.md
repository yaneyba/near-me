# SQL Directory - Clean and Organized

## Current Files

### ‚úÖ **Active Production Files**
- **`production-ddl-refactored.sql`** - Clean production schema reference (NEW STANDARD)
- **`targeted-migration.sql`** - Successfully executed migration script ‚úÖ

### üìö **Documentation**
- **`README.md`** - This file
- **`production-ddl-fixes-summary.md`** - Historical fixes summary

### üóÇÔ∏è **Archive**
- **`archive/`** - All legacy and redundant files

## What Was Accomplished

‚úÖ **Migration Completed Successfully**
- Removed hard-coded `is_admin_user()` function
- Replaced with service role policies
- All admin operations now use service role key
- User operations continue to work normally

‚úÖ **Files Organized**
- Kept only essential files
- Moved redundant migration attempts to archive
- Clear separation between current and legacy

## Next Steps

1. **Test Application** - Verify admin dashboard and user operations work
2. **Deploy to Production** - Apply the same migration to production when ready
3. **Clean Up Archive** - After confirming everything works, archive can be removed

## Architecture Summary

**Before**: Hard-coded email checks in database functions ‚ùå  
**After**: Environment variables + service role for admin operations ‚úÖ

**Admin Detection**: `VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable  
**Admin Operations**: Service role key via `AdminService`  
**User Operations**: Normal JWT authentication

### Step 3: Verify Migration
After running the migration, verify:
- No `is_admin_user()` function exists
- All admin operations work via service role
- User operations still work with JWT
- Admin dashboard loads properly

### Step 4: Use New DDL Reference
Going forward, use `production-ddl-refactored.sql` as the schema reference.

## New Architecture Benefits

### ‚úÖ Maintainable
- Admin emails in environment variables (`VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS`)
- No hard-coded values in database
- Easy to add/remove admins

### ‚úÖ Secure  
- Service role used for admin operations
- Proper separation of admin and user access
- No JWT-based admin detection in database

### ‚úÖ Clean
- No `is_admin_user()` function
- Clear RLS policies
- Proper service role usage

## Admin Operations Flow

### Application Level
```typescript
// Check if user is admin (environment variables)
const isAdmin = ADMIN_EMAILS.includes(user.email);

// Use service role for admin operations
if (isAdmin) {
  const adminService = new AdminService(serviceRoleKey);
  const data = await adminService.getAllSubmissions();
}
```

### Database Level
```sql
-- Service role policies
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage table" ON table_name
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails
1. Check that application changes are deployed first
2. Verify service role key is properly configured
3. Check that admin service is being used for admin operations
4. Review migration script output for specific errors

### If Admin Operations Don't Work
1. Verify `VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable is set
2. Check that admin service is using service role key
3. Verify user email is in the admin emails list
4. Test service role key directly in Supabase dashboard

## Notes

- All files implement email-based admin detection
- `admin-email-only-approach.sql` is the most refined version
- Remove any existing admin business_profiles entries (they're incorrect)
- Admins are platform managers, not businesses on the platform

The refactoring is complete and the SQL directory is now clean! üéâ
