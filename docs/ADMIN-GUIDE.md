## Admin User Setup

### Creating an Admin User

The system includes a script to create admin users with full access to administrative features. This script creates a user in Supabase Auth and sets the appropriate role in the `business_profiles` table.

#### Prerequisites

- Supabase project URL
- Supabase service role key (found in your Supabase dashboard under Project Settings > API)
- Node.js installed on your machine

#### Steps to Create an Admin User

1. Run the admin creation script:

```bash
npm run create-admin
```

2. When prompted, enter the following information:
   - Supabase URL (e.g., `https://your-project.supabase.co`)
   - Supabase service role key
   - Admin email address
   - Admin password
   - Business name (or "Admin")

3. The script will:
   - Create a new user in Supabase Auth
   - Skip email confirmation
   - Create a profile with the 'admin' role
   - Display confirmation of successful creation

#### Example Output

```

```

### Troubleshooting Admin Creation

If you encounter errors during admin user creation:

1. **"Error creating user"**: 
   - Verify your Supabase URL and service role key
   - Check if the email is already in use
   - Ensure password meets strength requirements (min 6 characters)

2. **"Error creating admin profile"**:
   - Verify the `business_profiles` table exists in your database
   - Check if the user was created successfully before the profile error

3. **"Network error"**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the Supabase URL is correct and accessible

## Authentication Management

### Toggling Authentication Features

The system includes a script to enable or disable authentication features without accessing the admin dashboard. This is useful for maintenance or when you need to quickly disable login functionality.

#### Steps to Toggle Authentication

1. Run the authentication toggle script:

```bash
npm run toggle-auth
```

2. When prompted, choose whether to enable or disable login functionality:
   - Enter `y` to enable login
   - Enter `n` to disable login

3. The script will:
   - Update the configuration in `.config/auth-features.json`
   - Update the `.env` file with the new settings
   - Display confirmation of the changes

#### Example Output

```
üîê Auth Features Toggle Script
=============================
This script allows you to toggle authentication features.

Current settings:
- Login enabled: Yes ‚úÖ

Enable login? (y/n) [y]: n

‚úÖ Auth feature flags saved to /home/project/.config/auth-features.json
‚úÖ Environment variables updated in .env file

‚úÖ Auth features updated successfully:
- Login enabled: No ‚ùå

Restart your application for changes to take effect.
```

### Effects of Disabling Login

When login is disabled:

1. Users cannot access the login page (redirected to home)
2. Protected routes redirect to home instead of login
3. Existing sessions remain active until expiration
4. The login button in the header is hidden

### Re-enabling Login

To re-enable login functionality, run the toggle script again and select `y` when prompted.

  - Useful for maintenance or security lockdowns

## Security Best Practices

### Admin Account Security

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
2. **Unique Email**: Use a dedicated email for admin accounts
3. **Limited Access**: Only create admin accounts when necessary
4. **Regular Rotation**: Change admin passwords periodically

### Service Role Key Security

The Supabase service role key has full access to your database. To keep it secure:

1. **Never expose it in client-side code**
2. **Only use it for admin scripts and server-side operations**
3. **Rotate the key if you suspect it has been compromised**
4. **Do not commit it to version control**

### Business Owner Account Security

1. **Verify Identity**: Confirm the business owner's identity before creating their account
2. **Secure Delivery**: Send credentials securely to the business owner
3. **Password Reset**: Encourage business owners to reset their password after first login
4. **Access Review**: Periodically review business owner accounts for suspicious activity

### Monitoring Admin Actions

1. Keep track of who has admin access
2. Review admin actions regularly
3. Remove admin access when no longer needed
4. Consider implementing audit logging for admin actions
