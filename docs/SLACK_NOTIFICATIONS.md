# Slack Notifications Setup

This document describes the Slack notification system integrated into the Near Me application.

## Overview

The application now sends real-time notifications to Slack for all form submissions and administrative actions. This helps the team stay informed about new submissions and track the status of business applications.

## Slack Webhook Configuration

**Webhook URL**: Configured in each API function file (not exposed in documentation for security)

**Configuration Files**:
- `functions/api/contact.ts` - Contact form submissions
- `functions/api/submit-business.ts` - Business submissions
- `functions/api/admin/business-submissions.ts` - Admin approval/rejection actions  
- `functions/api/admin/contact-messages.ts` - Contact message resolution

**Security Note**: The webhook URL is stored as a constant in each API function. For production, consider moving to environment variables.

## Implementation Details

### Slack Utility Functions
Location: `functions/utils/slack.ts`

The utility includes:
- `sendSlackNotification()` - Main function for sending notifications
- `SlackNotification` interface - Type definitions
- `buildSlackPayload()` - Formats messages for Slack
- `buildContactFields()` - Formats contact form data
- `buildBusinessFields()` - Formats business submission data

### Error Handling
- Slack notifications are sent asynchronously and don't block the main submission flow
- Failed Slack notifications are logged but don't cause the original request to fail
- All notifications include error handling with try/catch blocks

### Message Formatting
- Rich attachments with color coding
- Structured field layouts for easy scanning
- Truncated long messages (300 character limit)
- Clickable links to admin dashboard
- Timestamp and submission ID footers

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Webhook Health
- Monitor the Slack webhook URL for availability
- Check Slack channel for notification delivery
- Review server logs for failed notification attempts

### Notification Volume
- Track notification frequency to avoid spam
- Consider implementing rate limiting if needed
- Monitor Slack workspace notification settings

### Updates and Changes
- Update webhook URL in all endpoint files if changed
- Test notifications after any code changes
- Ensure proper error handling in all implementations

## Testing

To test the Slack notifications:

1. **Contact Form**: Submit a contact form through the website
2. **Business Submission**: Submit a business registration form
3. **Admin Actions**: Approve or reject a business submission through admin dashboard
4. **Message Resolution**: Resolve a contact message through admin dashboard

Each action should trigger a corresponding Slack notification with properly formatted content.

## Security Considerations

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Webhook URL Security**
- The webhook URL contains sensitive tokens and should NEVER be exposed publicly
- Currently hardcoded in source files - should be moved to environment variables
- Do not commit webhook URLs to version control
- Regularly rotate webhook URLs if compromised
- Monitor webhook usage for unauthorized access
- Consider using Slack's IP whitelisting for additional security

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add notification for user registrations
- Include engagement metrics in notifications
- Add notification preferences/filtering
- Implement notification templates
- Add support for multiple Slack channels
- Include direct action buttons in notifications
